Also, we will use this data to segment similar neighborhoods together.

It may need some renovations or adding a little Mondrian touch to it.\\n\\nHowever, this is not too important compared to the quality of food in this place.\\nWe ordered Edamame which was pretty good and shrimp tempura which was OK\\nAs for sushi, we ordered the Green Dragon, lobster salad Maki roll and the short beef ribs roll\\nThe presentation was beautiful, and we received way more rolls than we had anticipated based on the menu.\\nEach role tasted better than the one before, it's hard very thin layer of rice but so much feelings inside, that we were struggling to finish the portion.\\n\\nThere is no all you can eat option, and it is a bit pricey to order from the alacart menu, but it is certainly worth every dollar\\n\\nI will be back very soon and I will make sure to recommend this place\""

I could tell from the hard clump texture that I felt while biting into the sashimi and how warm the shrimp was. Which is regularly a softer texture and a delicate shellfish to serve. I had mild food poisoning from this. We also ordered Kalbi and it came out still raw in some spots ( red/bloody). When advised to the staff that this had happened they screamed at us in front of customers and told us we have to pay for it no matter what. Even though it was uncooked ( kalbi) and amaebi was no longer in raw form but half cooked form. Overall been here 2 times and never had a good experience. The staff were also never available either when it came time for us to pay for the items that were somewhat ok to still eat. \\n\\nDo not confuse this Gonoe with the one on 5 Glen Cameron, who happen to actually be five star and serve amazing quality sashimi and maki !  \\n\\nI DONT recommend this be your first choice in a sushi restaurant. Many better options even for AYCE.\""

This neighborhood falls in the MEDIUM INCOME FOODIES category and similar neighborhoods can be found well spreaded all over Toronto to consider a food chain. This area has a number of asian cuisine restaurants but they have been averagely or poorly rated on Yelp. Thus the client should keep in mind to replicate the good aspects of their competitors and improve on the bad aspects. They can additionaly introduce new ideas which their competitors lack in order to gain more tractions."

We have more than 1000 features from the Toronto Opendata Neighborhood profiles dataset, we can add more features like age-groups, employment statuses in order to better define neighborhoods. Also, we can make better use of the Yelp dataset but digging deeper into the customer reviews. The text contains more verbose information about our competition which will give us a better idea of what customers expect from a restaurant service. And Of course, this analysis can restricted to restaurants in Toronto only but given similar data about another city, we can conduct the same analyis for other types of businesses for different stakeholders."
